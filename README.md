## 🏉 What is DRL Coin?

DRL Coin (short for **Daegu Rugby Legends Coin**) is a **community-driven meme coin** created for and by the Daegu Rugby Legends team.  
It runs on a private, custom blockchain network originally built as an experiment in deploying ERC-20 style tokens on a bespoke Layer-1.  

Our goal is to celebrate the DRL community, experiment with blockchain technology, and create a fun token that can be used for **team events, giveaways, and on-chain experiments**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Meme Coin Spirit** — DRL Coin is not about speculation but about **fun, fandom, and experimentation**.
- **Layer-1 / Hardhat Compatible** — The contract was developed using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and can be deployed on a local chain or a public testnet.
- **ERC-20-like Token** — Built in Solidity 0.8.x with mint, transfer, and approve functions.
- **Community-Focused** — Distributed among DRL team members for memes, rewards, and events.
